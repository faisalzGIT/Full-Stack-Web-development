# WEB-DEV-by-CWH-All-Data
 This repository showcases my full stack web development learning journey. Currently, Iâ€™m building a Spotify website clone using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Before this, I completed projects to strengthen my frontend skills. I update this repo regularly as I make daily progress, reflecting my continuous growth in web development.
